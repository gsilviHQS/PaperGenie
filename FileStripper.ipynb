While this uncertainty fuels optimism, our optimism should be tempered with caution. We may feel confident that quantum technology will have a substantial impact on society in the decades ahead, but we cannot be nearly so confident about the commercial potential of quantum technology in the near term, say the next five to ten years.

I'm drawn to this field because I feel we are now in the early stages of exploring a new frontier of the physical sciences, what we might call the \\\\textit{complexity frontier} or the  \\\\textit{entanglement frontier}. This new frontier, while different than the frontier of particle physics or cosmology, is very fundamental and exciting. Now, for the first time in human history, we are acquiring and perfecting the tools to build and precisely control very complex, highly entangled quantum states of many particles, states so complex that we can't simulate them with our best digital computers or characterize them well using existing theoretical tools. This emerging capability will open the door to new discoveries.\",\n",
       " \"For a physicist like me, what is really exciting about quantum computing is that we have good reason to believe that a quantum computer would be able to efficiently simulate any process that occurs in Nature. We don't think that's not true for classical ({\\\\textit{i.e.}, non-quantum) digital computers, which (as far as we know) can't simulate highly entangled quantum systems. With quantum computers we should be able to probe more deeply into the properties of complex molecules and exotic materials, and also to explore fundamental physics in new ways, for example by simulating the properties of elementary particles, or the quantum behavior of a black hole, or the evolution of the universe right after the big bang. \",\n",
       " \"Our confidence that exploration of the entanglement frontier will be rewarding rests largely on two principles: (1) quantum complexity (our basis for thinking that quantum computing is powerful), and (2) quantum error correction (our basis for thinking that quantum computers are scalable to large devices solving hard problems). Underlying both of these principles is the idea of \\\\textit{quantum entanglement}. Entanglement is the word we use for the characteristic correlations among the parts of a quantum system, which are quite different from the correlations we encounter in everyday life. To understand the concept of entanglement, imagine a system with many parts, for example a book which is 100 pages long. For an ordinary classical 100-page book, every time you read another page you learn another 1\\\\% of the content of the book, and after you have read all of the pages one by one you know everything that's in the book. But now suppose instead that it's a quantum book, where the pages are very highly entangled with one another. Then when you look at the pages one at a time you see only random gibberish, and after you have read all the pages one by one you know very little about the content of the book. That's because the information in the quantum book is not imprinted on the individual pages; it is encoded almost entirely in how the pages are correlated with one another. If you want to read the book you have to make a collective observation on many pages at once. That's quantum entanglement, the essential feature making information carried by quantum systems very different from information processed by ordinary digital computers. \",\n",
       " 'An ordinary computer processes bits, where each bit could be, say, a switch which is either one or off. But to build highly complex entangled quantum systems, the fundamental information-carrying components of a quantum computer must be quantum bits, what we call \\\\textit{qubits}. A qubit can be realized physically in many different ways. It can be carried by a single atom, or a single electron, or a single photon (a particle of light). Or a qubit can be carried by a more complicated system, like a very cold superconducting electrical circuit in which many electrons are moving. ',\n",
       " 'When we speak of quantum complexity, what springs to mind is the staggering complexity of using ordinary classical data to describe highly entangled quantum states of many qubits. Giving a complete description of all the correlations among just a few hundred qubits may require more bits than the number of atoms in the visible universe. It will never be possible, even in principle, to write that description down, or to faithfully describe the processing of a few hundred qubits using classical language. ',\n",
       " 'This apparently extravagant complexity of the quantum world, though highly suggestive, does not by itself ensure that quantum computers are more powerful than classical ones. ',\n",
       " 'But we have at least three good reasons for thinking that quantum computers have capabilities surpassing what classical computers can do. ',\n",
       " \"First, we know of problems that are believed to be hard for classical computers, but for which quantum algorithms have been discovered that could solve these problems easily. The best known example is the problem of finding the prime factors of a large composite integer \\\\cite{shor}. We believe factoring is hard because many smart people have tried for many decades to find better factoring algorithms and haven't succeeded. Perhaps a fast classical factoring algorithm will be discovered in the future, but that would be a big surprise. \",\n",
       " \"It's a remarkable claim --- one of the most amazing ideas I've encountered in my scientific life --- that there is a distinction between problems that are classically hard and problems that are quantumly hard. And it is a compelling challenge to understand better what problems are classically hard but quantumly easy \\\\cite{zoo,montenaro}. We should recognize in particular that the power of a quantum computer is not unlimited. We don't expect, for example, that a quantum computer will be able to solve efficiently the hard instances of NP-hard problems like the traveling salesman problem. For such hard combinatorial search problems we probably can't do much better than exhaustively searching for a solution. Quantum computers can speed up exhaustive search \\\\cite{grover}, but only modestly \\\\cite{bbbv}, so NP-hard problems are likely to be quantumly hard as well as classically hard. \",\n",
       " \"For a physicist seeking problems which are classically hard and quantumly easy, the natural place to look is the task of simulating a many-particle quantum system. As two great physicists, Bob Laughlin and David Pines, put it some years ago \\\\cite{laughlin}, we have a ``theory of everything that is relevant to ordinary life.'' We have high confidence this theory is correct, and we can write down the equations precisely ---  they are the equations that describe how atomic nuclei and electrons interact electromagnetically. But we can't solve those equations. And so as Laughlin and Pines put it: ``We have a theory of everything only to discover that it has revealed exactly nothing about many things of great importance.'' Those things of importance they envisaged are the situations in the quantum world where entanglement has profound consequences. Dramatizing the futility of the task they proclaimed: ``No computer existing, or that will ever exist, can break this barrier'' of solving the equations describing many entangled particles.\",\n",
       " \"But in fact, years before Laughlin and Pines wrote these words, the physicist Richard Feynman had articulated a rebuttal \\\\cite{feynman}. As Feynman put it: ``Nature isn't classical dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of Nature you better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy.'' Feynman had envisioned using a quantum computer to solve the quantum physics problems that physicists and chemists had failed to solve using digital computers. Laughlin and Pines knew well that Feynman had made this proposal years earlier, but had dismissed his idea as impractical. Now, some 35 years after Feynman's proposal, we're just beginning to reach the stage where quantum computers can provide useful  solutions to hard quantum problems. \",\n",
       " \"So why is it taking so long? What is it about quantum computing that's so difficult? The core of the problem stems from a fundamental feature of the quantum world --- that we cannot observe a quantum system without producing an uncontrollable disturbance in the system. That means that if we want to use a quantum system to store and reliably process information, then we need to keep that system nearly perfectly isolated from the outside world. At the same time, though, we want the qubits to strongly interact with one another so we can process the information; we also need to be able to control the system from the outside, and eventually read out the qubits so we can find the result of our computation. It is \\\\textit{very} challenging to build a quantum system that satisfies all of these desiderata. It has taken many years of development in materials and control and fabrication to get where we are now. \",\n",
       " \"Eventually we expect to be able to protect quantum systems and scale up quantum computers using the principle of quantum error correction \\\\cite{gottesman}. The essential idea of quantum error correction is that if we want to protect a quantum system from damage then we should encode it in a very highly entangled state; like that 100-page book I described earlier, this entangled state has the property that the environment, interacting with parts of the system one at a time, is unable to glimpse the encoded information and therefore can't damage it. Furthermore, we've understood in principle how to process quantum information which is encoded in a  highly entangled state. Unfortunately, there is a significant overhead cost for doing quantum error correction --- writing the protected quantum information into a highly entangled book requires many additional physical qubits --- so reliable quantum computers using quantum error correction are not likely to be available very soon. \",\n",
       " \"Even with fault-tolerant quantum computing still a rather distant dream, we are now entering a pivotal new era in quantum technology. For this talk, I needed a name to describe this impending new era, so I made up a word: {\\\\textit{NISQ}. This stands for \\\\textit{Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum}. Here ``intermediate scale'' refers to the size of quantum computers which will be available in the next few years, with a number of qubits ranging from 50 to a few hundred.\\\\footnote{72-qubit and 50-qubit devices, based on superconducting circuits, have been announced recently by Google and IBM, respectively.} 50 qubits is a significant milestone, because that's beyond what can be simulated by brute force using the most powerful existing digital supercomputers.\\\\footnote{This ``milestone'' is actually a bit fuzzy, in several respects. In particular, the resources needed in a classical simulation depend on the depth (number of time steps) of the quantum circuit, as well as on the number of qubits \\\\cite{boixo,chen,ibm}.} ``Noisy'' emphasizes that we'll have imperfect control over those qubits; the noise will place serious limitations on what quantum devices can achieve in the near term. \",\n",
       " 'Physicists are excited about this NISQ technology, which gives us new tools for exploring the physics of many entangled particles. It might also have useful applications of interest to ',\n",
       " \"the business community, but we're not sure about that. We shouldn't expect NISQ is to change the world by itself; instead it should be regarded as a step toward more powerful quantum technologies we'll develop in the future. I do think that quantum computers will have transformative effects on society eventually, but these may still be decades away. We're just not sure how long it's going to take. \",\n",
       " \"I've emphasized the number of qubits as a measure of how difficult it is to do the simulation of a quantum computer on a classical device, but the number of qubits isn't the only thing we care about. We also care about the \\\\textit{quality} of the qubits, and in particular the accuracy with which we can perform quantum gates --- well-controlled entangling operations acting on pairs of qubits. With the best hardware we have now for controlling trapped ions \\\\cite{lucas} or superconducting circuits \\\\cite{martinis}, the error rate per gate for two-qubit gates is above the $.1$\\\\% level (and often much worse). Furthermore, we don't yet know whether error rates that low can be maintained in larger devices with many qubits; perhaps we'll find out soon. Naively, then, and as I'll say later this might be too naive, with these noisy devices we don't expect to be able to execute a circuit that contains many more than about 1000 gates --- that is, 1000 fundamental two-qubit operations --- because the noise will overwhelm the signal in a circuit much larger than that. \",\n",
       " \"That limitation on circuit size imposes a ceiling on the computational power of NISQ technology. Eventually we'll do better, using quantum error correction to scale up to larger circuits. But as I've already emphasized, since quantum error correction imposes a heavy overhead cost in number of qubits and number of gates, scaling up using quantum error correction is a more distant goal. When I speak of the NISQ era, I'm imagining quantum computers with noisy gates unprotected by quantum error correction. \",\n",
       " 'There are other things we care about, too, aside from the number of qubits and the gate error rate. The time it takes to execute a single  gate is also important for setting the time scale needed for a quantum computer to solve a problem, and it is noteworthy that superconducting circuits are about a thousand times faster than ion trap quantum processors. We need to be able to prepare and measure qubits accurately; currently the measurement error probability is about $1\\\\%$ for superconducting qubits, and much better than that for trapped ions. We care about the connectivity among the qubits --- for which pairs of qubits in our device can we perform an accurate two-qubit gate? It is also important to know how reliably we can fabricate qubits --- if we attempt to construct a many-qubit device, how many of the qubits actually perform well enough to be useful? These considerations and others, too, should be kept in mind when we make comparisons across different quantum computing platforms. ',\n",

When we speak of a quantum speedup, we typically mean that the quantum computer solves the problem faster than competing classical computers using the best available hardware and running the best algorithm which performs the same task. (Arguably, though, quantum technology might be preferred even if classical supercomputers run faster, if for example the quantum hardware has lower cost and lower power consumption.) In any case, we should recognize that the power of classical computers will continue to increase, with exascale systems (surpassing $10^{18}$ FLOPS) expected to be available in a few years. Quantum computers are striving to catch up with a moving target, as both classical hardware and classical algorithms continually improve. ',\n",

I was trying to emphasize that now is a very privileged time in the coarse-grained history of technology on our planet, and I don't regret doing so. But from a commercial perspective, obviously we should pay attention to whether the task is useful! Quantum supremacy is a worthy goal, notable for entrepreneurs and investors not so much because of its intrinsic importance but rather as a sign of progress toward more valuable applications further down the road. \",\n",

There are a variety of different notions of ``quantum machine learning.'' Much of the literature on the subject builds on quantum algorithms that speed up linear algebra and related tasks \\\\cite{qml,aaronson-fine-print}, and I'll address such applications in the ensuing subsections. \",\n",
       " \"First, though, I'll comment on the potential of quantum deep learning \\\\cite{duan}. Deep learning itself has become a broad subject \\\\cite{hinton}, but to be concrete let us contemplate a restricted Boltzmann machine. This may be regarded as a spin system in thermal equilibrium at a low but nonzero temperature, with many hidden layers of spins separating the input and output. (The word ``restricted'' means that there are no couplings among spins within a given layer; instead only spins in successive layers are coupled.) The system may have millions of coupling parameters, which are optimized during a training phase to achieve a desired joint probability distribution for input and output. The training may be supervised, for example the network might be taught to recognize a labeled set of photos, or unsupervised, in which case the goal is to identify patterns in an unlabeled training set of data. The quantum analog of such a machine could have a similar structure and function, but where the spins are qubits rather than classical bits. It may be that quantum deep learning networks have advantages over classical ones; for example they might be easier to train for some purposes. But we don't really know --- it's another opportunity to try it and see how well it works. \",\n",
       " 'One possible reason for being hopeful about the potential of quantum machine learning rests on the concept known as QRAM --- quantum random access memory. By QRAM we mean representing a large amount of classical data very succinctly, by encoding a vector with $N$ components in just $\\\\log N$ qubits. But typical proposals for quantum machine learning applications are confounded by severe input/output bottlenecks. For applications to large classical data sets one should take into account the cost of encoding the input into QRAM, which can nullify the potential advantages. Furthermore, the output from a quantum network is itself a quantum state; to get useful information we need to measure the state, and we can acquire no more than $\\\\log N$ bits of classical information in a single-shot measurement of $\\\\log N$ qubits.

Perhaps it is more natural to think about quantum machine learning in a setting where both the input and the output are quantum states. Hence we might expect a quantum network to have advantages over a classical one when used, for example, to control a complex quantum system. More broadly, it seems plausible that quantum deep learning would be more powerful than its classical counterpart when trying to learn probability distributions for which quantum entanglement has a significant role. That is, quantum deep learning networks might be very well suited for quantum tasks, but for applications of deep learning that are widely pursued today it is unclear why quantum networks would have an advantage.

Once we have the output state, we can perform measurements to learn features of the output vector $A^{-1}b$, and by repeating the scheme many times we can learn about the output vector in greater detail. But if we are trying to apply this matrix inversion algorithm to classical input data, we need to take into account the potential cost of loading that classical data into QRAM, which could nullify the exponential speedup. Alternatively, loading classical data into QRAM might be avoided by computing $|b\\\\rangle$ on a quantum computer rather than entering it from a database.',\n",

Taylor expanding the pure state fidelity around $\\\\bm{\\\\theta}$ we get\\\\begin{equation}\\\\label{eq:fidelity-fisher}\\tf(\\\\ket{\\\\psi(\\\\bm{\\\\theta})}, \\\\ket{\\\\psi(\\\\bm{\\\\theta} +\\\\bm{\\\\delta})}) = 1-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\bm{\\\\delta}^T \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) \\\\bm{\\\\delta} + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\bm{\\\\delta}^4),\\\\end{equation}where $\\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta})$ is the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) given by\\\\begin{equation}\\\\label{eq:qfim_def}\\\\mathcal{F}_{i j}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) = 4 \\\\Re{\\\\bra{\\\\partial_i \\\\psi} \\\\ket{\\\\partial_j \\\\psi} - \\\\bra{\\\\partial_i \\\\psi} \\\\ket{\\\\psi} \\\\bra{\\\\psi} \\\\ket{\\\\partial_j \\\\psi}}.\\\\end{equation}Assuming $\\\\bm{\\\\delta} \\\\ll 1$ we can neglect higher order terms in $\\\\bm{\\\\delta}$ and so\\\\be\\t\\tT(\\\\rho_A, \\\\sigma_A) \\\\lesssim \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\bm{\\\\delta}^T \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) \\\\bm{\\\\delta}} =\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\eta^2}{4} (\\\\nabla_{\\\\bm{\\\\theta}}E)^T \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) \\\\nabla_{\\\\bm{\\\\theta}}E}, \\\\ee\\twhere in the last equality we plugged in the parameter change under GD (Eq.~\\\\eqref{eq:gd}), $\\\\bm{\\\\delta}=-\\\\eta \\\\nabla_{\\\\bm{\\\\theta}} E$.']"
